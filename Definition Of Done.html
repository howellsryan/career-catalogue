            <p>The Definition of Done represents a set of conditions for a story undertaken by the development team to be considered complete (in regards to a sprint). These criteria ensure quality and consistency across all delivered work.</p>

            <p>Quality Assurance is a critical component of our Definition of Done process. QA should be involved throughout development rather than just at the end.</p>
            
            <ol class="steps-list">
                <li><strong>Early Involvement:</strong> QA should be included in story refinement to understand requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing Testing:</strong> Testing should happen throughout development, not just at the end.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Verification:</strong> QA performs final verification against acceptance criteria.</li>
                <li><strong>Sign-off Required:</strong> If there are issues found at the last stage, the item <strong>cannot</strong> be marked as done.</li>
