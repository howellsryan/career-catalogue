## Business Abbreviations a problem that no longer exists?

Iâ€™ve always had a hate for business abbreviations, introduced for efficiency, yet everyone is aligned that they cause headache, time waste and confusion.

Given copilot can now have full context of everything you have access to.. does this problem become non-existent with the right usage of AI?

I was faced with a problem this morning, two abbreviations I had zero clue of. A simple prompt to AI and within 30 seconds, I have the meaning, context and files to give me full confidence it is correct. Brilliant!
