(AI Generated)

## ⚡ What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**RAG** is a smart way to supercharge AI. Instead of guessing, it *retrieves* relevant content (from PDFs, policy docs, manuals) and then *generates* grounded responses based on that real data.

Perfect for internal tools, compliance-heavy systems, and AI you can trust.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Index Docs** → Split and embed into searchable vectors  
2. **Retrieve** → Match user query to relevant chunks  
3. **Generate** → AI uses the matched content to respond accurately
