# Initiative and challenging the default

One thing I look for in people is initiative. It sounds cliche, but I don’t want someone to just do. I appreciate outside of the box thinking and actively encourage it, it’s not disruptive to the team, but engaging and motivating. Challenging the default is challenging yourself and the team, and that takes effort, guts and determination.

In an era where everything seems to be changing weekly, people that show initiative and challenge the default are worth their weight in gold to a team and wider company.

Business processes can be seriously clunky, manual and most importantly, costly. It takes one brain wave and an individual who is challenging the default to change that, as long as they are in a team that actively encourages initiative. 

It’s my job as a leader to nurture this environment and help take that idea from being outside the box and against the grain, to standard.
