🧠 What is a vector space?

A vector space is a mathematical concept where data points (called vectors) live in a multi-dimensional space. Each vector is essentially a list of numbers, and each number represents a feature or attribute.

In AI, especially NLP, we use vector spaces to represent things like:

• Words
• Sentences
• Documents
• Customer profiles
• Insurance policies


Each of these is transformed into a vector—a point in a high-dimensional space—so that we can compare, search, and reason about them.

📦 Example: insurance policy as a vector

Imagine you have a motor insurance policy. You could represent it as a vector like this:

[5 years NCD, 0 claims, NG15 postcode, £500 premium, motor product]


After embedding, this becomes something like:

[0.12, -0.87, 0.45, 0.03, 0.91, ...]  ← 768 dimensions


Now this policy lives in a vector space alongside millions of others. You can:

• Find similar policies
• Cluster by risk
• Retrieve relevant rules
• Feed it into a next-best-action engine

🔍 Why vector spaces matter in AI

They allow us to:

• Measure similarity: Using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.
• Search semantically: “Find policies like this one” or “Retrieve rules relevant to this case.”
• Enable RAG: Embed queries and documents into the same space so they can be matched.

🧪 Visual analogy

Picture a galaxy 🌌 where each star is a document, rule, or customer. The closer two stars are, the more similar they are. That’s your vector space.

🧰 How it works in Azure

• Embedding: Azure OpenAI converts text into vectors.
• Storage: Azure AI Search stores these vectors in an index.
• Retrieval: You embed a query, search the space, and get the closest matches.
• Generation: The LLM uses those matches to generate a grounded response.

🧠 Bonus: dimensions ≠ complexity

Even though a vector might have 768 or 1,536 dimensions, it’s just a fancy way of saying “this thing has lots of nuanced traits.” The model learns what those traits mean—like tone, topic, intent, or risk level.
