# Getting Things Done Summary
Getting Things Done is a productivity methodology created by David Allen. It focuses on organizing tasks and projects to reduce stress and increase efficiency. 

Here are the key principles broken down:

**Capture**: Collect all tasks, ideas, and commitments in a trusted system (like a notebook or app).

**Clarify**: Process what each item means and decide the next action.

**Organize**: Categorize tasks into lists (e.g., "Next Actions," "Waiting For," "Projects").

**Reflect**: Regularly review your lists to stay on track.

**Engage**: Choose tasks based on context, time, energy, and priority.

## 2 Minute Rule
One of the key concepts within this methodology is if something takes less than 2 minutes to complete, rather than sorting it into lists and organising, **just do it**. 

## Delegation
He talks a lot around delegating to the team, but it isn't a case of forgetting about the task once it's delegated, but more around creating a new type of "Waiting For" list. I understood delegating as the following:

Ensure that both you and the person you're delegating to understand the task and its desired outcome.

Add task into "Waiting For" list.

Trust your team but check-in regularly, be available for any issues early on.

Regularly review your "Waiting For" list during your weekly review to stay updated on the status of delegated tasks

## Weekly Reflection
Part of the methodology talks about reflection being a key part of getting things done, understanding context of the week and keeping "things" on track.

**Review Your Calendar**: Look at the past week and figure out what was useful, what was not useful, can I better organise my week? Am I able to drop out of certain calls? Do I need more of a particular call? etc. Getting the right balance of meetings is difficult, too many and you lose productivity, too little and you're out the loop.

**Update Your Lists**: The idea that is that the lists are constantly updated and fairly correct in real-time, but this weekly reflection gives us a chance to make sure before end of week, e.g. Friday, the list is ready for next week.

**Review Long-term vision / Roadmap**: Gives me a chance to review on what the long-term vision is of Paul / John, are we heading in the right direction? Are we on-track to meet the roadmap deliverables?

**Plan for Next Week**: Start to creating items to complete next week, think of talking points for catchups, etc.
