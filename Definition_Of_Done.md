# Definition of Done Summary

## Criteria

The Definition of Done represents a set of conditions for a story undertaken by the development team to be considered complete (in regards to a sprint).

- Tests written and passing
- Continuous Integration build passing
- Security vulnerability scan passing
- Code peer-reviewed
- Documentation updated
- We believe all acceptance criteria are met
- The change is considered deliverable and Production ready
- QA should be involved throughout the process, so sign-off and acceptance is also included in definition of done. If there are issues found at the last stage, the item **cannot** be marked as done.
-  Deployed to Production (where possible / scenario based)
