I have found that the value of the daily scrum can become lost in teams very easily. The notion of check-ins and talking through blockers is an anti-pattern to being agile, instead the team should be collaborating and being made aware of any issues in real-time.


### The Value

The focus of a team working within sprints should always be on the sprint goal/s and the Daily Scrum is a great chance to align with what that is as well as deciding what the direction of the engineers' day is.

### Involvement

The meeting should be small and concise and only consisting of the small team that work day to day. **No outside involvement / derailment.**. 

While the engineers should all be aware of what each other are working on, there are is a lot of invisible work that goes during pair programming and side conversations, these scrum sessions are a good chance for the individuals to give clarity and context to others that weren't privy.

### Dos

- Do have a casual chat with the team.
- Do catch-up absentees.
- Do focus on the sprint goal/s.
- Do drive the agenda & priority for the day ahead for engineers.
- Do make invisible work visible.
- Do use the session for syncronisation.
- Do allow for course correction, if the sprint goal is no longer aligned with the teams goals, pivot!

### Donts

- Dont wait for the session to inform the team of blockers.
- Dont accept outside of team involvement.
- Dont follow a script.
- Dont hijack the meeting for progress updates.
