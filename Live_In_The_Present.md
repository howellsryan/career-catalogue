# Live in the Present

Make sure that you are living life in the present, especially work. Don't strive for the next thing all of your life and career, enjoy the particulars of the moment, good and bad, easy and stressful. Don't chase the next pay-rise as before you know it, it'll be the normality and the cycle of chasing the next thing will continue. 

Be conscious and aware of reality, back yourself and trust yourself to make decisions, the next steps in life and your career will present themselves organically and at the right times.
