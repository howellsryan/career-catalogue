I am a big believer in a person performing the best when they have full focus on a single task at hand. In my personal experience, when I have multiple tasks ongoing at once, I don’t deliver to the best of my ability on any of them. As an Engineer, I believe the single biggest impact to being able to achieve high quality code is context switching and not having full laser-sharp focus on the job at hand.

## Little's Law

Little’s law is a theorem that suggests working on multiple tasks simultaneously will increase the time spent in total. It highlights a fundamental relationship between the number of items you are actively working on and how long it takes to complete a given task. In essence, the more work you have in progress, the less you release, which increases the cycle time and that decreases the amount of work done in a sprint.

Using this theorem and averages, we can apply it to calculate a definitive equation on Cycle Time: 

Average Cycle Time = Average Work in Progress / Average Throughput

## Analogy
If you had 20 customers / hour in a coffee shop and a customer takes 15 minutes in the shop, then, in theory, on average of 5 customers are in the shop at any given time.

## Strict One Piece Flow Process

An example process of a team working in a strict one piece flow manner is:

1.	Taking one feature from the backlog
2.	Completing analysis
3.	Moving directly to development
4.	Conducting immediate testing
5.	Deploying to production
6.	Only then starting the next feature

## My Personal Opinion

My two pence on this is that I want my engineers to be strict with their own process ensuring that they follow a one piece flow mindset, taking on one task at a time, and, until it's completed, focusing solely on that, ensuring that they only ever have one work item **active**. 

I am a huge advocate of **pair programming** and using the **mob programming** techniques, but instead, leaving it in my engineers' capable hands to choose and decide when’s best to use it as a team. 

My job is to push best practices on the team, challenge fixed mindsets and provide a path to achieve a better cycle and lead time, not dictate ways of working to my team that are masters of their craft.
