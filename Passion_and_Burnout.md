As an engineering leader, one of my constant concerns with the engineers on my team is **burnout and stress**.

Why, when I am such a preacher of this, do I ignore my own advice? I reflect almost daily on the work I completed through the day, what I did well, what I could have done better, and more times than not, I come to the conclusion: **I did too much**.

That sounds like I’m trying to do less, but it’s the opposite; I want to do more and have an overwhelming and sometimes overreaching ambition.

I have a thing where I struggle to feel stress. I love the pressure, I love the challenge, I’m a problem solver and engineer at heart; the problems keep me motivated. But there is a **fine line** I tread and have trod for many years, bordering burning out and a **passionate obsession** with my work.

Last weekend, I crossed that line and ended up feeling unwell for 2 days that was directly stress-related. Luckily, it landed on the first of my 4-day weekend; unluckily, it was my 30th birthday weekend.

I’ve come back into work today with a different outlook on the day and week ahead: **focus on what’s in front, limit reach so that it doesn’t become overreach, and protect myself first and foremost through a dedicated working schedule**. Once that working schedule ends, stop and start a new end-of-work routine before spending the evening with family.

I conclude on that: **passion and ambition are crucial and necessary to succeed, but you must be able to switch off and rejuvenate frequently**. Stay focused on what’s most important, trust your team with delegation, and **don’t let your passion turn into an unhealthy work-obsessed addiction**.
