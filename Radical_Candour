As an engineering manager, my primary focus is building and nurturing a high-performing team. Over the years, I've learnt that the secret to achieving this isn't just about having the most skilled engineers or the flashiest tech stack. It's about fostering an environment of trust and open communication. This is where the concept of **Radical Candour** proves its worth.

## What is Radical Candour?

Radical Candour is a communication framework built on two simple, yet powerful, principles: **Caring Personally** and **Challenging Directly**. At its heart, it's about genuinely caring for the people you work with, whilst also being willing to have the difficult, necessary conversations. It’s not an excuse to be brutally blunt or overbearing, but rather to be kind and clear in your feedback.

Here's my take on it:

* **Caring Personally:** This is the bedrock of the whole approach. It's about building genuine relationships with your team members. It’s taking the time to understand their motivations, their career goals, and the challenges they face. When your team knows you are in their corner, they'll understand that you're invested in their success.

* **Challenging Directly:** This is where the "radical" part comes into play. It’s about having the courage to step into uncomfortable conversations. It means giving direct, honest, and actionable feedback, even when it feels awkward. When you challenge directly, you're not criticising the person; you're addressing a specific behaviour or piece of work.

## Radical Candour in Action

So, how do I put Radical Candour into practice with my team? Here are a few examples:

* **Praise in Public, Offer Feedback in Private:** When a team member does something brilliant, I make sure to praise them publicly. This not only recognises their hard work but also sets a positive example for everyone else. When someone needs constructive feedback, I always do it in a private, one-to-one setting. This creates a safe space for them to receive the feedback without feeling embarrassed or defensive.

* **Focus on Behaviour, Not Personality:** When giving feedback, I always focus on specific behaviours and their impact. For instance, instead of saying, "You're always late," I'll say, "I've noticed you were late to our last three team meetings. When you're late, it disrupts the flow of the meeting and we have to repeat information for you." This approach is far more objective and less likely to put the person on the defensive.

* **Actively Solicit Feedback:** Radical Candour is a two-way street. I make it a regular practice to ask my team for feedback on my own performance. This not only helps me to grow as a manager but also demonstrates to my team that I value their opinions and am open to being challenged myself.

## Why It Matters

Implementing Radical Candour isn't always the easy option. It requires a bit of courage, vulnerability, and a genuine commitment to your people. The benefits, however, are immense. When you cultivate a culture of Radical Candour, you build a team that is:

* **More engaged:** Team members feel valued, respected, and understood.
* **More innovative:** They feel safe enough to take calculated risks and learn from their mistakes.
* **More resilient:** They are equipped to have tough conversations and work through challenges together.

Ultimately, Radical Candour is about building a team that is not only high-performing but is also a genuinely great place to work. And as an engineering manager, that's what it all about.
